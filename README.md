# Hollow Knight Mod 
Program that makes modifications to the game Hollow Knight. 

# Features 
1. Custom currency input
2. Infinite health ((999 health) Must lose at least 1/5 health then you can enabled this.)

# Notes 
Unfinished currently. However, I do plan to add more and improve the quality of the code as I continue to sharpen my C++ skills.  

Attempting to compile revamped.cpp will result in major syntax errors. I am reconstructing the program in revamped. If you intend to try this 
program, please use main.cpp for now.
